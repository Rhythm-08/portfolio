            I'm a Software Developer with 2+ years of professional experience, specializing in 
            Frontend Development (Angular, D3.js) and AI/ML Engineering. 
            I thrive at the intersection of product engineering and applied machine learning.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            At <strong>ChicMic Studios</strong>, Iâ€™ve contributed to both the AI/ML and Angular teams, 
            building ERP systems, multilingual platforms, and interactive data visualizations. 
            Iâ€™ve also engineered LLM-based automation pipelines, clinical trial data extraction workflows, 
            and RAG-driven chatbots for intelligent knowledge retrieval.

            Most recently, Iâ€™ve been working as an 
            <strong>Associate Software Developer</strong> at 
            <a href="javascript:void(0)" (click)="openLink(companies[0].url)" class="company-link">ChicMic Studios</a>, 
            where I led projects across AI/ML pipelines, ERP systems, and full-stack applications. 
            Key highlights include:
          </p>
  
          <ul>
            <li>âœ… Built an AI-powered <strong>Quality Audit Automation</strong> tool for legal document review (60% faster verification).</li>
            <li>âœ… Engineered a <strong>clinical trial data pipeline</strong> with SpaCy NER, PubChem/Springer integration, and LLM fine-tuning.</li>
            <li>âœ… Developed a <strong>role-based task management system</strong> in Node.js for construction projects.</li>
            <li>âœ… Created an interactive <strong>D3.js radial drug categorization graph</strong> with dynamic filtering.</li>
            <li>âœ… Improved website SEO & performance by optimizing rendering, APIs, and internationalization.</li>
          </ul>
  
          <p>
            Before that, I worked on Angular-based ERP modulesâ€”such as interview scheduling, 
            awards feedback, and subscription managementâ€”and contributed to CredKeeper, 
            where I built authentication, credit-based gamification, and AI-powered article generation.
